# RequirementEngineering
Project for Uni  

The project consisted in proposing a solution for a selected institution.
The aim of the course was to learn effective communication between the client and the executive team.
As a result of the work, two documents were created containing a full description of the client's requirements and needs and a prototype of the application.

This repo contains eg:
- Catalog of requirements
- Information, fucntional and non-fucntional requirements
- Busineess rules
- Acceptance tests
- Conceptual model
- prototype
